# Automatic-License-Plate-Detection
This project involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images. The goal is to improve automation in traffic management and law enforcement.

**Dataset:** Utilized a pre-annotated dataset consisting of 433 images.

**Data Processing:** Extensively processed XML Files and converted annotations into YOLO format.

**Model Training:** Trained a YOLOv8 model for 100 epochs.

**Performance Metrics:** Achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.7 at IoU=0.5 and at IoU=0.5:0.95.

**Deployment:** Successfully deployed the trained model using Streamlit for real-time license plate detection.
